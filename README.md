# Nether_Bedrock_Cracker
Cracks nether seeds from bedrock

## Usage
### Rust
Install Rust https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install <br />
After that consider using linux cause there it was just one command

### Repo
Next clone/download the repository and open the main.rs file to configure bedrock positions and thread count

### Running
open your terminal in the repository folder and type:

    cargo run
    
The program should now start and be done in a few minutes. For me it takes ~12 minutes on a single thread
